<b>Objective:</b> <br>
Transforming Legal Document Processing with RAG
This project is designed to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to revolutionize the way legal documents are managed and interpreted. By integrating intelligent retrieval with generative AI, the solution will empower businesses, law firms, and regulatory bodies to enhance productivity, reduce manual effort, and make smarter legal decisions.
